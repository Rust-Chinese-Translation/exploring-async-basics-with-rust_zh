# Callbacks

## 2. Process callbacks
The next step is to handle any callbacks we've scheduled to run.

```rust, ignored
fn run_callbacks(&mut self) {
    while let Some((callback_id, data)) = self.callbacks_to_run.pop() {
        let cb = self.callback_queue.remove(&callback_id).unwrap();
        cb(data);
        self.pending_events -= 1;
    }
}
```

Here we `pop` off all callbacks that are scheduled to run. As you see from our last update on the `Runtime` struct. `callbacks_to_run` is an array of callback_id and an argument type of `Js`.

So when we've got a `callback_id` we find the corresponding callback we have stored in `self.callback_queue` and remove the entry. What we get in return is a callback of type
`Box<dyn FnOnce(Js)>`. We're going to explain this type more later but it's basically a closure stored on the heap that takes one argument of type `Js`.

`cb(data)` runs the code in this closure. After it's done it's time to decrease our counter of pending events: `self.pending_events -= 1;`.

> Now, this step is important. As you might understand, any long running code in this callback is going to block our `event loop`, preventing it from progressing. So no new callbacks are handled and no new events are registered. This is why it's bad to write code that blocks the event loop.

Let's recap by looking at what members of the `Runtime` struct we used here:

```rust, ignored
pub struct Runtime {
    callback_queue: HashMap<usize, Box<dyn FnOnce(Js)>>,
}
```
